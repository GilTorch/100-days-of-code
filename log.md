# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added notifications when break time or work time ends.

**Thoughts:** It was pretty easy. I then worked in the tic-tac-toe app but no major changes.

#Day 2: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried to solve bugs in my tic tac toe app.

**Thoughts:** After a couple of hours I didn't solve any bug but decided to use the MVC design pattern to solve it the next day.
